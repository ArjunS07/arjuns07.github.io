### Who I Am

I'm an 11th-grade student at The Shri Ram School, Moulsari, in Delhi NCR, India. I've been programming in some way or the other since I was eleven years old, and today, am the head of my school's computer society, Megabyte.

Aside from tech, I like learning about just about anything. If I'm not on my terminal, you'll usually find me reading an obscure Wikipedia page, bingewatching 3blue1brown math videos, or convincing myself I'm being productive by building unnecessary Notion pages.

### On blogging

Back in third grade, I was an overenthusiastic cricket fan who was only able to catch up on matches that finished after his bedtime by reading the next day's match reports. Over time, I wanted to try my own hand at producing cricket coverage, and so I started a fortnightly 'cricket magazine' which I sold to my classmates... for the cost of _A-4 sheets_.

Later, when I was twelve, I was an avid reader of tech blogs and opinion pieces, in particular, Dieter Bohn's _Processor_ series for _The Verge_. By then, I'd come to genuinely enjoy writing as a way of challening my interest in topics I was passionate about, and so started my own technology blog - taking heavy inspiration from columnists like Bohn (whose influence you can quite clearly see in my earlier writing).

I've since written dozens of posts about tech news, media, and a whole lot more, which live on my [blog](/blog) today.

### My favourite apps and software

* Browser: [Arc](https://arc.net/)
* Launcher: [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)
* Window manager: [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/)
* Markdown editor and note-taker: [Bear](https://bear.app/)
* Podcasts: [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/)

### My favourite books

I enjoy most genres, but my favourite books generally cover some mix of science, technology, history, and business.

* _**Project Hail Mary**_ by Andy Weir
* _**The Day of the Jackal**_ by Frederick Forsyth
* _**The Conquerer**_ series by Conn Iggulden
* _**Creative Selection**: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs_ by Ken Kocienda

### What I build things with

My backend framework of choice is [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), but I've also enjoyed working with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/).

I like [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) for building mobile apps, but I got my start doing serious programming with [Swift and UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit) and I still have a soft spot for them. When building for the web, I still run screaming at the sight of any CSS more advanced than what you'd see in an introductory crash course (`nth-child` the what now?), which is why I so frequently use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as well as [Bulma](https://bulma.io).

Recently, I've been learning [Julia](https://julialang.org/) for scientific computing, and finally gotten around my dislike of JavaScript by working on [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/).

You can check out my [GitHub](github.com/ArjunS07) to see what I'm working on right now.
