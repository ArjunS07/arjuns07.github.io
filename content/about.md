I'm a 12th-grade student in Delhi NCR, India. I've been programming in some way or the other since I was eleven years old, and today, am the head of my school's computer society, Megabyte.


### On blogging

Back in third grade, I was an overenthusiastic cricket fan who was only able to catch up on matches that finished after his bedtime by reading the next day's match reports. Over time, I wanted to try my own hand at producing cricket coverage, and so I started a fortnightly 'cricket magazine' which I sold to my classmates... for the cost of _A-4 sheets_.

Later, when I was twelve, I was an avid reader of tech blogs and opinion pieces, in particular, Dieter Bohn's _Processor_ series for _The Verge_. By then, I'd come to genuinely enjoy writing as a way of challening my interest in topics I was passionate about, and so started my own technology blog - taking heavy inspiration from columnists like Bohn (whose influence you can quite clearly see in my earlier writing).

I've since written dozens of posts about tech news, media, and a whole lot more, which live on my [blog](/blog) today.
