I'm a 12th-grade student in Delhi NCR, India. I've been programming in some way or the other since I was eleven years old and began [my best attempt](/blog) at a [Dieter Bohn](https://www.theverge.com/authors/dieter-bohn) impression a year after that. Over the years, I've gravitated towards musing on the code I write, speculating on the implications of technological developments across industries, as well as reviewing software and media in the world of computers.

Currently, I'm the head of my [school computer club](https://tsrsmegabyte.com), a machine learning enthusiast, a casual astronomy fan, and an Oxford comma devotee. My [GitHub](https://github.com/ArjunS07) is the best place to check out what I'm working on. The subject I'm most interested in learning about right now is [positive unlabelled machine learning](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/NSF/PSC-IIS-0307239.html).

Occasionally, my terminal window has been found closed. I've spent these times discovering that my favourite book is Kurt Vonnegut's _Slaughterhouse-Five_, having also enjoyed Andy Weir's _Project Hail Mary_, Conn Iggulden's _Conquerer_ series, Ken Kocienda's _Creative Selection_, and Katie Mack's _The End of Everything_, amongst others.

43 of the 50 songs I've spent the most time listening to [on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/312t5wi46n3yze3f6kuyjza4mspu?si=f765f49e744641fa) are by the [The Mountain Goats](https://www.mountain-goats.com). The piece of software which brings the most joy to my life every day is [Downlink](http://downlinkapp.com). [News Minimalist](https://www.newsminimalist.com) is the coolest tool I've used recentlyâ€“and not just because it reminds me that artificial intelligence is about more than copyright law and tech doomerism.

This website was built with a [custom fork](https://github.com/ArjunS07/personal-website) of the [Congo theme](https://github.com/jpanther/congo) for the [Hugo](gohugo.io) framework.
