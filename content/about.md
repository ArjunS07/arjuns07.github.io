I'm a 12th-grade student in Delhi NCR, India. I've been programming in some way or the other since I was eleven years old, and today, am the head of my school's computer society.

### On blogging

Back in third grade, I was an overenthusiastic cricket fan who was only able to catch up on matches that finished after his bedtime by reading the next day's match reports. Over time, I wanted to try my own hand at producing cricket coverage, and so I started a fortnightly 'cricket magazine' which I 'sold' to my classmates (the currency of exchange? Blank A-4 sheets.)

Later, when I was twelve, I was an avid reader of tech blogs and opinion pieces. By then, I'd come to genuinely enjoy writing as a way of channeling my interest in topics I was passionate about, and so started my own technology blog. In my earlier writing, you can see my attempts to mimic my influencesâ€“Dieter Bohn and his [_Processor_ newsletter](https://www.theverge.com/processor-newsletter-dieter-bohn-show-video), and John Gruber's [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/) blog.

Since then, I've written dozens of [posts](/blog) about the computer industry, technology-related media, and more. More recently, as I've improved as a [programmer](https://github.com/ArjunS07), I've begun engaging in technical writing and tutorials.
