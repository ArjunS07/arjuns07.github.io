Being a student is hard. Your phone and the internet usually don't help make it easier, with their plethora of distractions luring you from deadlines. Believe it or not, though, there are some tools which dilute rather than augment disturbance, and improve rather than distract from your assignments - making your grades and productivity soar higher than they could without them.

1. **Notion** - It's likely that at some point, you've tried to make notes to help you revise, or, more likely, made notes to make you _feel_ like you were helping yourself revise. Those notes can often end up evolving into overwhelmingly long word documents where you struggle to distinguish between monotonous paragraphs. That's where Notion comes in. Notion is a free app for all major desktop and mobile platforms which allows you to create well-organised notes, in addition to a plethora of other features. Its main selling point for note-taking its toggle feature, which allow you to have collapsible pieces of text - letting you add revision questions in your notes which hide their answers, get a quick overview of points without having to see all of their sub-points, and much more.

2. **Dark Reader** - As hard What you put on your notes and documents often depends on your internet-browsing skills, but it's hard to that if your eyes feel like they're being burnt to a crisp by site with their blistering white backgrounds and high-contrast design language. This browser extension, enables you to force dark mode on websites as you browse the web - easing the burden on your gaze when burning the midnight oil.

3. **TabCopy** is another extension ideal for such a situation, by generating a copyable list of all your tabs and their links which you can save somewhere else, allowing you to close your dozens of tabs without worrying about losing them.

4. **Video Speed Controller**: This Chrome extension has no doubt saved countless hours for those who have used it to blitz through videos for research projects or binged guilt-free entertainment in a fraction of the time it would normally take. It's hard going back to watching anything at that snail-paced speed _normal_ people in films, video, and TV talk once you've had a few days with this extension - and it's even better for speeding through videos on sites which don't natively support speed control, when you're looking for solutions to math problems or want to crank up revision videos on YouTube past double speed.

5. **Noisli.com**: Staying focused through that hard work, is always difficult. is a website that provides up to 1.5 hours per day of free, highly customisable background audio to focus to, drowning out external distractions and noise.

6. **Forest**: This browser extension is another productivity booster that boosts your incentive to focus by planting a virtual tree that dies when you visit sites on your blocklist or stray anywhere from your allowlist - a surprisingly potent way to ensure that you don't end up sinking time into the many distractions the internet is teeming with.

7. **Sleepyti.me**: After all that hard work, you deserve a good night's rest which'll allow you to wake up in the morning. The doctor-recommended minimum of eight hours of sleep doesn't always ensure that you don't feel groggy â€” it turns out that if you wake up in a middle of one of your 'sleep cycles', you end up feeling tired when awake, but if you wake up right between cycles, you'll likely be fresh and energetic.  allows you to optimise your sleep schedule  based on these cycles by telling you when to go to bed based on when you need to wake up, what time to wake up if you go to bed now, or when to wake up based on when you plan to go to sleep. Try following its research-backed recommendations, and you'll wonder how you ever managed to survive without it.

These utilities won't magically solve your problems. But they will help fight distraction, increase focus, and improve your content and research abilities. Now all that's left is to find an app that adds hours to the clock.
