_This review contains spoilers for all of_ Project Hail Mary __by Andy Weir. Now's the time to look away if you plan to read it but haven't yet!_ _

If you're familiar with Andy Weir's past work, Project Hail Mary shouldn't appear surprising.

It's a science fiction read about a do-gooder, eccentric, science nerd, who finds himself stranded in deep space, and needs to use his ingenuity to make his way out. Here, it's about Ryland Grace, a high school science teacher-turned-astronaut, who's part of a mission to figure out how to solve a crisis caused by 'Astrophage' sucking up the sun's energy. There's no shortage of hard sci-fi - in this case, mostly biochemistry and a bit of rocket science - for hardcore fans to sink their teeth into, but it's also well-balanced by the narrator's easygoing style and the generally light-hearted tone of the plot.

It'd be hard to blame you, then, if you thought that, after his rather forgettable outing with _Artemis_, Weir had decided to go back to the basics and reskin _The Martian_. It does share a lot of the same elements - most of the above paragraph would apply just as well to the hit-turned-blockbuster as it does to _Hail Mary_. And some parts of it seem to very clearly be responses to criticisms of Weir's other works - Mission Director Stratt's steel-faced character's portrayal seems to be intentionally contrastful to the poorly-received descriptions of Jazz Basha in _Artemis_.

But you'd be wrong.

Unlike Weir's other works, fundamentally, _Hail Mary_ isn't so much a story of the goodness of its protagonist as it is a story about what it means to be human. And it does this by challenging the expectations of its readership and genre, rather than attempting to satisfy and define them.

And how does Weir establish his narrative about humans?

Aliens!

But it's clear that Weir wants to challenge the conventional tropes associated with the arrival of species from another planet in his genre. Instead of being humanoid, significantly superior invaders, they're rock-shaped equals with the same goal. Their unusual form works well to challenge the arbitrary nature of human behaviours and societal attitudes, offering a contrast not to a perfect 'other' but to another flawed species.

Weir, then, consistently sets up situations which create expectations for a particular set of outcomes typical of the genre and his works, but subverts them. You expect the amnesiac hero to be motivated by a greater desire to do good for the human species, even at the cost of his own life - as does he - but it turns out he's just there because he was forced to, with the hope that he'd eventually be a good enough person to follow through after he recovered his memory and physical ability completely. And he doesn't make his way back to Earth at the end, despite his new status as a hero – instead choosing to become a teacher on his alien friend's planet.

It's hard to describe just how much of a twist that is. Stories like these _never_ end with the human protagonist, with no general enemity for the human race, choosing not to return to earth. That's like Mark Watney deciding to stay on Mars at the end of _The Martian_.

But it's these choices in Weir's fundamentally flawed but also fundamentally good protagonist that help you get to what feels like the real point of the story.

Weir doesn't want you to think anything but that Ryland Grace is a perfectly normal human, representative of the entire species - on a quite literal level to the aliens of 40-Eridani - and as such, symbolises what Weir ultimately thinks humans are capable of.

Sure, they may not be perfect, and might run from that which intimidates them at the first, but they're still capable of selfless acts of braver`y and collaboration. And fundamentally, they're worth saving.

Andy Weir's Project Hail Mary doesn't transform its genre, but it doesn't try to. It's not _The Martian_, but it does capture the spirit that made it special. And it won't change the world - but it might change the way you see the humans who live on it.
