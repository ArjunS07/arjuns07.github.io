If you're familiar with Andy Weir's past work, Project Hail Mary should not be a difficult read. The science fiction saga centres on Ryland Grace, an academic turned middle school science teacher turned spacefaring hero, who's part of a crew meant to find a solution to a looming, sudden ice age threatening the planet.

This ice age is discovered to be caused by single-celled life called 'Astrophage', which use carbon dioxide to reproduce, and large amounts of energy. The book is told as two parallel stories, one during the mission, and one from before takeoff in which Grace recovers from his amnesia induced by four years of coma - a reliable, even if orthodox, device to reveal background information at the right time to the reader as the story progresses.

Because of this, Weir is able to leverage plot twists to make a story about a man largely alone in deep space engaging to follow. The elaborate science of the devices of the story, plus real-life rules, are the fulcrum for these turns. There's no shortage of elaborate ideas in the story for hardcore fans of the genre to sink their teeth into, but that part is typically balanced for the rest of the readership by the (relatively) light-hearted overall tone of the book, considering its subject matter.

It sounds a lot like Weir's past work - getting into the weeds of biochemistry and physics when put to the test by a scrappy spacefaring scientist with a distinct sense of humour, desperately fighting for survival against insurmountable odds.

But Project Hail Mary is far more than that.

The following section contains minor spoilers for the plot and events of the book

It's a story about hope and humanity – with a healthy dollop of aliens. The member of the alien species with whom Grace spends the second half of the book working with challenged my conventional ideas about extraterrestrial life – think more spider-like than humanoid – and is a convenient way to comment on the eccentricities of human behaviour, and of the human species. The protagonist's final decision at the end – to stay on Erid (the name he gives to the planet of the aliens from the system of 40 Eridani) rather than return to Earth - serves as a dramatic twist that subverts expectations for this category of storytelling.

The final revelation in the parallel story set on Earth – that Grace was forced against his will to board the ship after an accident that killed the original crewmate and his backup – is hinged on the belief of Stratt, the mission director, that Grace is a fundamentally good being who'll eventually do the right thing, even if it means a one-way ticket to space. This arc of realisation for the protagonist, going from thinking as an amnesiac he volunteered as a hero to save his species, to realising he had to be coerced, to finally accepting his fate and finding a new life as a teacher on an alien planet; is a compelling one. The story succeeds in leaving in its reader optimism in the fundamental nature of human beings. The emotional crescendo of the final pages, in which the earth's survival - plagued in legitimate doubt throughout the book - is excellently crafted, and I found the final act as a whole to be the most rewarding part of narrative.

Andy Weir's Project Hail Mary is a comfortable read that rewards all categories of its readers. It doesn't transform its genre, and won't change the world - but it might change the way you see it.
