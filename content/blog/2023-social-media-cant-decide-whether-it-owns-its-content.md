Are these platforms charging
I don't think that's what's motivating these sudden changes. Reddit webscrapers have existed since forever, and the concept of APIs isn't new. Nor do I think this is . Reddit in particular is surely aware that a large percentage of their traffic comes from third-party API access
The interesting question here is whether these platforms see LLMs as an existential threat.

> access or use the Reddit Services and Data through any means (including by accessing our API or indexing, caching, or crawling our Reddit Services and Data) to train large language, artificial intelligence, or other algorithmic models or related services without our permission; or

it might be inspired by Elon Musk's new Twitter policies, but probably not.

> Reddit CEO Steve Huffman told The New York Times this week that he didn’t want to give a freebie to the world’s largest companies. “Crawling Reddit, generating value and not returning any of that value to our users is something we have a problem with,” he said.

But how does the value get returned to users?

> But so far only a few public deals over access to training data have been announced, such as photo bank Shutterstock agreeing to license content to OpenAI. Its rival Getty Images is suing Stability AI, an OpenAI competitor, for not seeking a license before allegedly using over 12 million photos. The AI startup’s response is due in US federal court next week.

> Those users could reasonably clamor for their own compensation if Stack Overflow succeeds in licensing to AI makers the questions and answers they write for free. Chandrasekar says, “There's absolutely thought going into how best to make sure that our community members and the people that make the site what it is today—how we are going to take care of them in the context of what's happening here.”

> Neither Stack Overflow nor Reddit has released pricing information. “We're working on that as we speak,” Reddit spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt says, “and will share more with partners in the coming weeks.” Stack Overflow will study Reddit’s strategy and consult with its own potential customers, some of whom have already reached out about data access, Chandrasekar says. 

> But Chandrasekar says that LLM developers are violating Stack Overflow’s terms of service. Users own the content they post on Stack Overflow, as outlined in its TOS, but it all falls under a Creative Commons license that requires anyone later using the data to mention where it came from. When AI companies sell their models to customers, they “are unable to attribute each and every one of the community members whose questions and answers were used to train the model, thereby breaching the Creative Commons license,” Chandrasekar says.


> AI systems are, at their core, built upon the vast wealth of human knowledge and experiences. They learn by training on data – for example open-source code and Stack Overflow Q&A. It is precisely this symbiotic relationship between humans and AI that ensures the ongoing relevance of community-driven platforms like Stack Overflow. Allowing AI models to train on the data developers have created over the years, but not sharing the data and learnings from those models with the public in return, would lead to a tragedy of the commons. It might be in the self-interest of each developer to simply turn to the AI for a quick answer, but unless we all continue contributing knowledge back to a shared, public platform, we risk a world in which knowledge is centralized inside the black box of AI models that require users to pay in order to access their services. 


This is correct, and Iv'e talked about this before. Hope to see from stackoverflow's own GenAI plans.
