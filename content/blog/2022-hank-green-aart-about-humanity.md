_The following article contains mild spoilers for the entirety of 'An Absolutely Remarkable Thing' by Hank Green_

What if you woke up one day to find out that you're now the most-watched person in the history of the internet? And what if that content was a video of you introducing an otherworldly, mysterious, robot sculpture that you found at 3 AM in New York City and dubbed 'Carl'?

In Hank Green's debut novel, protagonist April May - a fresh-out-of-college designer - is living a largely unremarkable life when her world is turned upside down, and she's forced to reckon with precisely this new reality. Along the way, she achieves an unprecedented level of internet fame, is acquainted with the President, and goes up against the political pundit leading the movement opposing the Carls in what becomes the centre of political discourse in this new world.

That's not all that the story's about, though. An Absolutely Remarkable Thing is, at its core, an examination of fame and its ability to make addicts of and dehumanise those gifted with it.

It's also a perfect lens through which to understand the current moment in culture, politics, and humanity - as the book points out, the Carls are the perfect blank slate on which to project all of your pre-existing notions and biases and manufacture a culture war around.

That is, of course, if Green's lens is the one through which you wish to hear this discourse about the current state of societies. As a renowned vlogger, online educator and entrepreneur, he's experienced some degree of the kind of internet fame the narrator experiences in the book – and while he and April aren't the same, there are times when the voices of the narrator and the author appear to merge - like when April lists what she sees as the '5 tiers of fame' or says that 'pundits don’t want to talk about what’s happened; they want to use what’s happened to talk about the same things they talk about every day'. This doesn't necessarily detract from the book. It does, however, make clear that the story wishes to inform its readers in a particular way.

But not shying away from toeing the line is precisely what makes this story so special. Ultimately, its true villain isn't Carl or the extremists or the pundits who emerge from the culture war. It's fame itself.

It's abundantly clear that Green's trying to accomplish more than writing a cool sci-fi story about alien robots or a piece about the culture war as it exists today.

It's about the best that humanity is capable of when enabled by technologies like the internet to encourage positive communities and when those same technologies can rip lives, politics, and countries apart.

It'd be hard to argue that _An Absolutely Remarkable Thing_ is a masterpiece of a political commentary or that it's capable of satisfying a hardcore science fiction audience like _Seveneves_ or _Red Mars_ can. But in pulling the best elements from both of those genres, it's a compelling narrative for anyone interested  what it means, in an era of unprecedented levels of access to information and communications technologies, to be human.

And based on what Green seems to be trying to say, that should be everyone.
