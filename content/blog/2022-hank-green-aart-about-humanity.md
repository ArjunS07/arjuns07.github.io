_The following article contains mild spoilers for the entirety of 'An Absolutely Remarkable Thing' by Hank Green_

What if you woke up one day to find out that you're now the most-watched person in the history of the internet? And what if that content was a video of you introducing an otherworldly, mysterious, robot sculpture that you found at 3 AM in New York City and dubbed 'Carl'?

In Hank Green's debut novel, protagonist April May - a fresh-out-of-college designer - is living a largely unremarkable life when she's confronted by that bizarre experience. As her world is turned upside down, she becomes the symbol for humanity's connection with what seems like an alien force. Along the way, she builds an unprecedented level of internet notoriety, and leads the faction supporting cooperation with the Carls in a new culture war that emerges out of this alien invasion.

Reducing this story to a sci-fi trope, though, would be doing a disservice, by neglecting its examination of the nature of fame. _An Absolutely Remarkable Thing_ is, at its core, a study of the ability of fame to strip away our humanity and make addicts of those cursed with it. You see over the course of the first-person narrative the corrosion of the narrator's identity: how, in desperately aspiring to live up to her carefully-cultivated internet persona, she becomes her carefully cultivated internet persona.

The emergence of the Carls is also used as a lens with which to understand the current moment in culture and politics. As the book points out, the Carls are the perfect blank slate on which the artifices of the present culture war can be projected, and with which new tensions can be manafactuared in toxic spaces online.

That is, of course, if Green's lens is the one through which you wish to be presented this analysis of society in the twenty-first century. As a renowned vlogger, online educator and entrepreneur, he's experienced some degree of the kind of internet fame the narrator experiences in the book – and while he and April aren't the same, there are times when the voices of the narrator and the author appear to merge. When April lists what she sees as the '5 tiers of fame', or says that 'pundits don’t want to talk about what’s happened; they want to use what’s happened to talk about the same things they talk about every day', the book seems to drift from the narrative to being closer to a script for one of Green's YouTube videos. This heavy-handed delivery of his personal perspective on the internet doesn't necessarily detract from the book. It does, however, make clear that the story wishes to inform its readers in a particular way.

But not shying away from toeing the line is precisely what makes this story so special. Ultimately, its true villain isn't Carl, or the violent extremists and political pundits who emerge from the culture war. It's fame itself.

It's abundantly clear that Green's trying to accomplish more than writing another alien invasion story, or to directly participate in the culture war as it exists today. Fundamentally, _An Absolutely Remarkable Thing_ is a reminder of the ability of democratised access to technology to _amplify_ humanity: to empower our greatest capabilities to inspire justice, change, and communitybuilding; and to feed our worst proclivities towards provoking fear, tribalism, and violence.

Still, it would be hard to argue that _An Absolutely Remarkable Thing_ is a literary masterpiece or a seminal political commentary. And, perhaps in fear of alienating the general audience that previous 'YouTuber books' have attracted, Green shies away from providing much depth to the science fiction roots of the story, in a way that would leave fans of the genre disappointed.

But in pulling the best elements from both of the genres it steps into, this is a compelling narrative for anyone interested in what it means to be human in the age of the internet. Green seems to think that should be everyone.
