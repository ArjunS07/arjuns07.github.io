_The following article contains mild spoilers for the entirety of 'An Absolutely Remarkable Thing' by Hank Green_

What if you woke up one day to find out that you're now the most-watched person in the history of the internet? And what if that content was a video of you introducing an otherworldly, mysterious, robot sculpture that you found at 3 AM in New York City and dubbed 'Carl'?

In Hank Green's debut novel, protagonist April May - a fresh-out-of-college designer - is living a largely unremarkable life when she's confronted by that bizarre experience. As her world is turned upside down, she becomes the symbol for humanity's connection with what seems like an alien force. Along the way, she builds an unprecedented level of internet notoriety, and leads a faction which opposes a political movement that fears the Carls, in a narrative that hijacks present political discourse to forge a new culture war.

That's not all that the story's about, though. An Absolutely Remarkable Thing is, at its core, an examination of fame and its ability to make addicts of and dehumanise those gifted with it. You see over the course of the first-person narrative the corrosion of the narrator's identity: and how, in _pretending_ to be her carefully-cultivated internet personality, she becomes her carefully cultivated internet personality.

It's also a perfect lens through which to understand the current moment in culture, politics, and humanity. As the book points out, the Carls are the perfect blank slate on which pre-existing notions and biases can be projected, and with which new tensions can be manafactuared in toxic spaces on the internet.

That is, of course, if Green's lens is the one through which you wish to hear this discourse about the current state of societies. As a renowned vlogger, online educator and entrepreneur, he's experienced some degree of the kind of internet fame the narrator experiences in the book – and while he and April aren't the same, there are times when the voices of the narrator and the author appear to merge - like when April lists what she sees as the '5 tiers of fame' or says that 'pundits don’t want to talk about what’s happened; they want to use what’s happened to talk about the same things they talk about every day'. This heavy-handed delivery of Green's personal perspective on the internet doesn't necessarily detract from the book. It does, however, make clear that the story wishes to inform its readers in a particular way.

But not shying away from toeing the line is precisely what makes this story so special. Ultimately, its true villain isn't Carl, or the violent extremists and political pundits who emerge from the culture war. It's fame itself.

It's abundantly clear that Green's trying to accomplish more than writing a cool sci-fi story about alien robots or a piece about the culture war as it exists today. Fundamentally, _An Absolutely Remarkable Thing_ is a book which is about the ability of democratised access to technology to _amplify_ humanity: to empower our greatest capabilities to inspire justice, change, and communitybuilding; and to feed our worst proclivities towards provoking fear, tribalism, and violence.

Still, it would be hard to argue that _An Absolutely Remarkable Thing_ is a literary masterpiece or a seminal political commentary. And it shies away from leaning towards its science fiction roots, perhaps in fear of alienating the general audience that previous 'YouTuber books' have attracted.

But in pulling the best elements from both of its genres, this might perhaps be a compelling narrative for anyone interested in what it means to be human in the age of the internet. 

And based on what Green seems to be trying to say, that should be everyone.
