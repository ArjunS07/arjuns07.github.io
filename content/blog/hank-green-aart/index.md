*The following article contains mild spoilers for the entirety of 'An Absolutely Remarkable Thing' by Hank Green*

What if you woke up one day to find out that you've featured in the most-watched piece of content in human history? And what if that content was a video of you introducing an otherworldly, mysterious, robot sculpture that you found at 3 AM in New York City and dubbed 'Carl'?

In Hank Green's debut novel, protagonist April May - a fresh-out of college designer - is living a largely unremarkable life when her world is turned upside down and she's forced to reckon with this new reality. Along the way, she becomes an internet sensation, acquainted with the President, and the chief TV political pundit advocating in favour of the Carls in a global clash of ideologies.

That's not all that the story's about, though. An Absolutely Remarkable Thing is, at its core, an examination of fame, and its ability to make addicts of, as well as dehumanise those, gifted with it. It's also a perfect lens through which to understand the current moment in culture, politics, and humanity - as the book points out, the Carls are the perfect blank slate on which to project all of your pre-existing notions and biases, and manufacture a culture war around.

That is, of course, if Green's lens is the one through which you wish to view that moment. Green is a renowned vlogger, online educator and entrepreneur, who's seen more than his fair share of internet fame. At times, the voice of the narrator and Green himself appear to merge - particularly when April lists what she sees as the '5 tiers of fame' or says that 'pundits don’t want to talk about what’s happened; they want to use what’s happened to talk about the same things they talk about every day'. This doesn't necessarily detract from the book, it does, however, make clear that the story wishes to inform its readers in a particular way.

But not shying away from toeing the line is exactly what makes this book so special. Ultimately, the villain of the story isn't carl, or even the extremists and assasins who emerge from the culture war. It's fame itself.

It's abundantly clear that Green's trying to accomplish more than just write a cool sci-fi story about alien robots, or a piece about the culture war as it exists today. It's about the best that humanity is capable of when enabled by technolgoeis like the internet to encourage positive communities, and when those same technologies can be used to rip lives and countries apart. It's not *The Great Gatsby* or *The Martian*, but it does perhaps capture the best of the spirit of both as best as a singular novel can.
