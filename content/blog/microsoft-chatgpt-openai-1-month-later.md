Almost exactly one month ago, [I wrote](/blog/microsoft-chatgpt-language-bing) about how the success of ChatGPT and Microsoft's (almost concerningly) close relationship with OpenAI is going to put pressure on rival firms to release their own language models and might mark a turning point in generative AI.

A few things of note have happened since then:

* Sensationalist media have sensationalised GPT-3 and its planned successor to the point where OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has himself stated said that people are [going to be disappointed](https://www.theverge.com/23560328/openai-gpt-4-rumor-release-date-sam-altman-interview) by GPT-4.

* Microsoft's gotten even closer to OpenAI, having recently announced a [new 'multibillion-dollar investment'](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/23/23567448/microsoft-openai-partnership-extension-ai) in the firm. A lot of that money is going to go back to Microsoft in the form of Azure bills, but it's still clear that Microsoft sees tremendous value in generative AI in their software for both enterprise and consumer audiences.
  
  * They've '[launched 'Teams Premium'](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/2/23582610/microsoft-teams-premium-openai-gpt-features), which includes, amongst other features, automatic generation of notes, tasks, and meeting highlights using GPT-3.5.
  * More curious are the screenshots of Microsoft's ChatGPT-powered version of Bing that [leaked yesterday](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/3/23584675/microsoft-ai-bing-chatgpt-screenshots-leak), which describe Bing as an 'AI-powered search engine', and which show a version of ChatGPT that - as was speculated [on this blog](/blog/microsoft-chatgpt-language-bing) and by several others - pulls data directly from the web to generate responses, and, more importantly, is capable of citing its sources.

In what's been a very successful January for Microsoft - their stock is up 12.77% over the past month - there's one rival of theirs that is conspicuously absent from the mainstream conversation about generative AI.

One rival which [received its first pull request from its cofounder](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2023/01/31/sergey-brin-code-request-lamda/?sh=af267b57ce68) in years; a rival which seems increasingly pressured to disregard the ['reputational risk'](https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/14/23508756/google-vs-chatgpt-ai-replace-search-reputational-risk) associated with generative AI that previously concerned them; and a rival that's already facing pressure from [the US government](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/24/23569127/google-advertising-monopoly-antitrust-lawsuit-federal-government) over antitrust concerns, even as it lays off [thousands](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/20/google-to-lay-off-12000-people-memo-from-ceo-sundar-pichai-says.html) of its workforce.

These haven't exactly been the best few weeks in Google's history. This is perhaps the closest they've ever gotten to being existentially threatening, as their core products - search and advertising - are being threatened from multiple directions even as they experience a post-pandemic lull.

That's not to say that this is the end of Google, or that their search product will be completely wiped out by Microsoft. At this point, it may be hard to remember that they [were the ones](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html) to come up with the core machine learning architecture underlying LLMs in the first place and that they've been showing off their generative models for years - albeit in highly controlled environments - at Google IO.

Google's just [invested $300M](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-invests-almost-400-million-184850399.html) in an AI research lab founded by ex-OpenAI employees, and their CEO has [stated](https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2022_Q4_Earnings_Transcript.pdf?cache=c632791) their intent to "rethink and reimagine... Search", making their language models "available, starting with, LaMDA, so that people can engage directly with them". These are bold moves, and ones that they almost certainly wouldn't have made were it not for the tremendous pressure being created by Microsoft and OpenAI.

If there's one consolation for Google in everything that's hit them this month, it's this: by the time IO 2023 rolls around, they'd probably be a lot less worried about fighting regulatory [pressure](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-google-monopolizing-digital-advertising-technologies) against their monopoly on search. Because that monopoly might just be over.
